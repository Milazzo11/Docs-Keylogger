Keylogger program written in Python.  This program will write keys entered on a computer and enter them into a Google Document.

You can specify the document link by changing the contents of the doclink.txt file.  This is a windows program, and all packages must be installed for it to correctly work.
The Chrome browser is also required to connect to the internet to write to the Google Document (as a Chrome driver is used for internet connection).

NOTE: Do not edit the cleartext.txt file

Use this program responsibly (only for tests and personal use).  Enjoy :)
